device-management-refactoring.eap contains Enterprise Architect diagrams. Under Windows, you can obtain a free EAP file viewer from http://sparxsystems.com.au/bin/EALite.exe. Under Linux, you're out of luck unless you can use Wine or something. The full EA version officially only works under Linux using CrossoverOffice.

For your convenience, I've exported the two diagrams:
- EA Class Diagram.png (printing to PDF didn't work quite right - the diagram was cropped)
- EA Resource Resolution Sequence Diagram.pdf (or EA Resource Resolution Sequence Diagram.png)
