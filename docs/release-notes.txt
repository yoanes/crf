==== Version 0.0.3 (tag: contentRenderingFramework_v0_0_3) ==== 

Tagging initial commit under contentRenderingFramework. This was copied from the previous, temporary CVS
home of mcs/crp.

Code base should be ready for component integration (albeit possibly with a few rough edges). 
Basic JavaScript resolution now works (<name>.js and *.js forms but with no bundling).

==== Version 0.0.2 (tag: crp_v0_0_2) (in old mcs/crp CVS home) ==== 

JSP resolution, basic CSS and basic image resolution done (except for img tag width and height output).

==== Version 0.0.1 (tag: crp_v0_0_1) (in old mcs/crp CVS home) ==== 

JSP routing via (configurable) .crp extension implemented. Show case demonstrates JSP routing
via both forwards and includes.
