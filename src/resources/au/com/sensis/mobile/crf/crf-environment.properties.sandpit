# the minimum time delay to wait before updating the refresh count. For example, if this is 
# set to 60000 milliseconds, we effectively allow a maximum of one refresh to be counted every 
# 60 seconds, regardless of how many attempts were truly made. This ensures that the recovery 
# attempts will span a non-trivial amount of time.
